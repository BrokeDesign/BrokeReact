<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://brokeds.netlify.com/) 

While there are plenty of css frameworks, design systems, and react component libraries out in the wild, it can be a struggle to find one that allows simple implementation and use along with heavy trust in the user to customize to their needs without having to jump through hoops. This project aims to remediate that.

### Built With

* [SASS](https://sass.com) 
* [React](https://reactjs.org)
* [Webpack](https://webpackjs.com)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.com)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Broken Design System is in it's very earliest stages at them moment so it's important to keep in mind that frequent updates will be the norm. Right now, what is available for use is very limited.

### Installation
//TODO: This will be added when base features are implemented

**Node Module**

_npm_
```sh
npm i -D @brokeds/broke-everything
```

OR

_yarn_
```sh
yarn add -D @brokeds/broke-everything
```

Then import the module inside of your entrypoint (eg. `src/index.js`)
```js
import @brokeds/broke-everything
```


**Github repo**

Clone the repo and navigate to the full feature directory

```sh
git clone https:://github.com/SkothaSec/BrokeDS.git  && /
cd ./BrokeDS/BrokeEverything
```


Install NPM packages and start the server

```sh
npm i && yarn start
```

OR

```sh
yarn add && yarn start
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Using CSS in react app:

**Import package in entry file**
